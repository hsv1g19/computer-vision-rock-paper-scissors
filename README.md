# Computer Vision RPS

I have created an image project model on Teachable-machine with four different classes: rock, paper, scissors, and nothing.Each class is trained with images of myself showing each option to the camera. The "Nothing" class represents the lack of option in the image. The more images I train with, the more accurate the model will be. I took around 1000 images for each class in different positions of the same action.

I will later use this model named keras_model.h5 and the text file containing the labels named labels.txt. Which, contain the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model. They are not files that can be run, and they do not contain anything readable if you look inside. Later, I will load them into your Python application in the next milestone. In the project I will use these files to compare against my own code for rock paper scissors.
